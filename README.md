## Setup

1. Clone this repo & cd into it

2. Rename 'TEMPLATE.config.json' to 'config.json' & add your token into it. You can also change the settings of it if you want.

3. Install required packages with `npm i`.

4. Start it with `node server.js` or if you want it to restart automatically if it crashes (hopefully won't happen) use `nodemon server.js`
